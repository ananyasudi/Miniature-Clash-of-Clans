### Notes
--> followed OOP in building this game
we've different classes where each of them represents
    --buildings
    --kings
    --canons
    --barbarian
    --archers
    --balloons etc
--> here few classes are inherited from parent classes
example: hut class is inherited from building class, king is child class of person (parent class) etc

-->each of classes have different methods and constructors
for example:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hit_pts=1
        self.damage=2
        self.health=30
    this is constructor for person's class

### Encapsulation:

it is a way where we bundle data and methods together. we've bundled attributes and methods in a class. so, we've used encapsulation

### Polymorphism

it is about having different interfaces for same function. for example if we want to calculate addition of 2 numbers. now we can write different functions with same name where one of it taes integers, other takes decimals etc.

### Execution
run python3 game.py
enter 'K' for choosing king and 'Q' for choosing queen

use -A for moving king to left
    -D -->move king to right
    -S -->move king down
    -W --> move king up
    spacebar -->to attack huts/townhalls
    1,2,3--> create barbarian
    4,5,6---> creates balloons
    7,8,9-->creates archers
    -Q-->quit game
